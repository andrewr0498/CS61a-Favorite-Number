### What's your favorite number?

#### Purpose:
In this repository I take a look at the distribution of answers, by CS61a students, to the question: "What's your favorite number?" 

#### Data:
The data for this analysis was collected using a Google Form survey, and then distributed to CS61a students. There are two datasets, one from the Fall 17 semester, and one from the Spring 18 semester. The data was initially in an sql file but I then converted it to a csv file.

#### Additional Packages:
The only additional package used in this project is ggplot2.
